# In this project I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify customer order statistics.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6 AND orderid<> 'orderid';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid)=6 AND orderid<> 'orderid';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS C
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.febsales AS FS
ON C.order_id = FS.orderid
WHERE LENGTH(orderid)=6 AND orderid<> 'orderid';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT MIN(price),
product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue,
product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product,
SUM(Quantity) AS total_sold,
SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(C.acctnum),
AVG(quantity)*price AS avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.febsales AS FS
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS C
ON FS.orderid=C.order_id
WHERE FS.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<>'orderid';

#8 List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in the month of February and how many of each was sold.
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS number_sold, Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

#9 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6

#10 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product = 'iPhone'

#11 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6

#12 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT MIN(price)FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#13 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue,
product 
FROM bit_db.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#14 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product,

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#15 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM bit_Db.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN bit_db.customers cust
