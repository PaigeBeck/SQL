In this code I am querying a database that holds information about marathon runners.

//#1 Select every participant and the percentage of the marathon they completed.//
SELECT participant_name, 
completion_fraction*100 AS completion_percent
FROM marathon;

//#2 Select every participant and the percentage of the marathon they completed, rounded to 1 decimal place. //
SELECT participant_name, 
ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) AS completion_percent
FROM marathon;

//#3 Show how many people completed each quarter of the marathon. //
SELECT COUNT(*),
CASE WHEN completion_fraction >=.75 THEN "75%+"
WHEN completion_fraction >=.5 THEN "50%+"
WHEN completion_fraction >=.25 THEN "25%+"
ELSE "Under 25%" END AS "quarter_completed"
FROM marathon
